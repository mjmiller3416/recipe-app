"""Upload API endpoints for image handling via Cloudinary.

All endpoints require authentication to prevent unauthorized uploads.

Images are addressed in Cloudinary by the recipe's stable ``image_key`` (not its
mutable primary key), so URLs stay valid across environments (local SQLite vs
prod Postgres) and never collide with a different recipe's id. The key is
resolved server-side from the recipe the caller owns, which also enforces that
a user can only upload images for their own recipes.
