          You must provide accurate information when creating an account and keep your

          You own the recipes, images, meal plans, and other content you add to the service.
          By uploading content, you grant us the limited license needed to store, display, and
          process it for you — including hosting images with Cloudinary and sending relevant
          context to Google Gemini when you use AI features. You are responsible for making
          sure content you import or upload doesn&apos;t infringe anyone else&apos;s rights.

          AI features (recipe generation, URL import, the assistant, cooking tips, nutrition
          estimation, and image generation) produce automated output that may be inaccurate or
          incomplete. Nutrition estimates are informational only and are not medical or dietary
          advice — always verify ingredients and allergens yourself. AI usage may be subject to
          reasonable limits.
