          # Git workflow conventions for commits and PRs
          prompt: |
            Follow these git conventions strictly:

            Commit messages: Use conventional commits format
              <type>: <description>
            Types: feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs, test, style, perf
            - Lowercase type, lowercase description, no period at end
            - Imperative mood ("add" not "added")
            - Under 72 characters

            PR titles: Derive from branch name or summarize commits
            PR body: Include Summary, Changes, and Test Plan sections

            Always end commits with:
            Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>

            Target all PRs to the staging branch, never to main directly.
